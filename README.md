## Implementations

### Linear Regression
**Explanation:**  
Linear Regression is a foundational supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes there is a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target). The model fits a straight line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions) that best represents the data by minimizing the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted values.

The equation for multiple linear regression is:  
\[
\hat{y} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \theta_n x_n
\]  
where \(\hat{y}\) is the predicted value, \(x_i\) are the features, and \(\theta_i\) are the coefficients learned from the data.

Linear regression is widely used because of its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency. It provides intuitive insights into the relationship between predictors and the outcome, making it a great starting point for regression tasks.

**Pros:**  
- Easy to understand and explain.  
- Fast training and prediction, scalable to large datasets.  
- Provides explicit coefficients representing feature importance.  
- Performs well when the true relationship is approximately linear.

**Cons:**  
- Assumes linearity, which may not hold for complex data.  
- Sensitive to outliers that can disproportionately influence the fit.  
- Does not handle multicollinearity or interactions without additional processing.

**Use Cases:**  
Ideal for problems where the relationship between variables is expected to be linear, such as predicting house prices based on square footage, sales forecasting, or any scenario requiring numeric prediction from straightforward features.

### Logistic Regression
**Explanation:**  
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used primarily for binary classification problems. Unlike linear regression, it outputs probabilities by applying the logistic (sigmoid) function to a linear combination of input features, squashing real values into the range [0,1]. This probability can then be thresholded (commonly at 0.5) to assign class labels.

The model estimates the odds of the positive class via:  
\[
p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_n x_n)}}
\]  
where \(p\) is the probability of the positive class, and \(\beta_i\) are model parameters.

It is widely favored for its simplicity, efficiency, and ease of interpretation. Coefficients indicate the direction and strength of feature influence on the likelihood of belonging to a class.

**Pros:**  
- Simple, interpretable classification model.  
- Outputs calibrated probabilities useful for decision-making.  
- Efficient and effective on linearly separable classes.  
- Works well on relatively small or medium-sized datasets.

**Cons:**  
- Assumes a linear decision boundary; limited with complex patterns.  
- Performance degrades if classes are not linearly separable.  
- Requires feature engineering for non-linear or high-dimensional data.

**Use Cases:**  
Common in medical diagnosis, credit scoring, spam detection, and customer churn predictionâ€”any binary classification task requiring explainability and probability estimates.

### Random Forest Regression
**Explanation:**  
Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning method that builds a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mean prediction of the individual trees. It can capture complex non-linear relationships and interactions among features without requiring explicit feature engineering.

Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data and considers a random subset of features at each split, increasing diversity and reducing overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

**Pros:**  
- Handles non-linear and complex relationships well.  
- Robust to noisy data and outliers.  
- Automatically captures feature interactions.  
- Provides feature importance scores.

**Cons:**  
- Computationally intensive and slower to train and predict.  
- Results are less interpretable than linear models; often considered a black box.  
- Requires hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.

**Use Cases:**  
Appropriate for datasets with complicated patterns and relationships, common in finance, biology, ecology, and any regression setting where the underlying process is not linear.

### Ridge Regression
**Explanation:**  
Ridge Regression is a linear regression variant that incorporates L2 regularization to penalize large coefficients. By adding a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients, it shrinks coefficients and thus reduces model complexity and collinearity issues. It is especially useful when predictors are highly correlated.

The objective function optimized in Ridge is:  
\[
\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^p \theta_j^2
\]  
where \(\alpha\) controls the strength of regularization.

**Pros:**  
- Reduces overfitting and improves model generalization.  
- Handles multicollinearity effectively by shrinking coefficients.  
- Keeps all features in the model (does not perform feature selection).

**Cons:**  
- Does not produce sparse models; no automatic feature elimination.  
- Requires tuning of the regularization parameter \(\alpha\).

**Use Cases:**  
Well-suited for datasets with many correlated features or when the number of features is large relative to the number of samples, improving stability and predictive performance of linear models.

### Lasso Regression
**Explanation:**  
Lasso Regression adds L1 regularization to linear regression, which adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This encourages sparsity, shrinking some coefficients exactly to zero, thus performing implicit feature selection and simplifying models.

The objective function optimized in Lasso is:  
\[
\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^p |\theta_j|
\]

**Pros:**  
- Performs regularization and feature selection simultaneously.  
- Produces simpler and more interpretable models.  
- Can improve prediction accuracy by reducing overfitting.

**Cons:**  
- May struggle when features are highly correlated (tending to pick one arbitrarily).  
- Requires careful tuning of \(\alpha\) for best results.

**Use Cases:**  
Effective for high-dimensional datasets with many irrelevant features, common in bioinformatics, text data, and any problem where feature selection is critical.

### Support Vector Regression (SVR)
**Explanation:**
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an extension of Support Vector Machines (SVM) tailored for regression tasks. Instead of classifying data, SVR finds a function that approximates the relationship between input features and continuous target values with an emphasis on creating a margin (called the epsilon-insensitive tube) around the predicted function within which errors are not penalized. The goal is to fit as many data points as possible within this margin, minimizing prediction error without overfitting.

SVR can use different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, RBF) to map input data into higher-dimensional spaces, allowing it to capture complex, nonlinear relationships. The choice of kernel and model hyperparameters like C (regularization strength) and epsilon (width of the margin) controls the balance between model complexity and tolerance for prediction errors.

**Pros:**

Can capture complex nonlinear relationships using kernels.

Robust to outliers through the epsilon margin.

Effective in high-dimensional feature spaces.

**Cons:**

Selecting appropriate kernel and hyperparameters requires care.

Training can be computationally expensive on large datasets.

Less interpretable than simpler linear models.

**Use Cases:**
SVR is well-suited for regression problems with nonlinear patterns, such as predicting stock prices, environmental measurements, or any scenario where relationships are complex but a robust regression model is needed.

### Gradient Boosted Regression Trees
**Explanation:**
Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) are an ensemble learning method that builds a strong predictive model by combining many weak learners, typically shallow decision trees, in a stage-wise fashion. Each successive tree is trained to fit the residual errors (gradients) of the combined prior trees, gradually improving overall prediction accuracy.

GBT models are powerful for capturing nonlinear dependencies and interactions among features since each new tree focuses on correcting the mistakes of the previous ensemble. This sequential learning approach allows for flexibility and strong predictive performance in complex datasets.

**Pros:**

High prediction accuracy, often outperforming other algorithms.

Handles mixed data types and complex feature interactions well.

Can be tuned by adjusting number of trees, learning rate, tree depth for performance optimization.

**Cons:**

Training can be slower compared to simpler models.

Prone to overfitting if not properly tuned.

Less interpretable than single decision trees.

**Use Cases:**
Ideal for regression problems where high accuracy is required on complex, non-linear datasets such as finance, insurance pricing, and many real-world tabular prediction tasks.

### Decision Tree Regression
**Explanation:**
Decision Tree Regression is a non-parametric supervised learning method that predicts continuous numerical outputs by recursively partitioning the feature space into regions. The algorithm splits data based on feature thresholds that minimize prediction error within each partition (e.g., mean squared error).

The final prediction for a sample is the average target value of samples within the relevant leaf node. Decision trees are intuitive and easy to visualize, capturing non-linear relationships without needing feature scaling.

**Pros:**

Simple to understand and interpret visually.

Captures nonlinear relationships and feature interactions.

Requires little data preprocessing.

**Cons:**

Prone to overfitting if trees grow too deep.

Sensitive to small variations in data, causing unstable splits.

Typically less accurate than ensemble methods.

**Use Cases:**
Useful as baseline models for regression tasks, exploratory data analysis, and scenarios where model interpretability is crucial, such as basic pricing predictions or preliminary modeling before ensembles.
