# AI-ML-Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various **Machine Learning algorithms** in Python. The goal is to build a comprehensive collection of ML techniques with clear, well-documented code examples and explanations to help learn and apply these algorithms effectively.

---

## Current Implementation

So far, this repository includes a detailed implementation of **Linear Regression**. The project covers:

- Loading and exploring a customer dataset
- Visualizing relationships between variables using Seaborn
- Preparing data and splitting it into training and testing sets
- Training a multivariable Linear Regression model using Scikit-Learn
- Detailed model evaluation with coefficients, R-squared score, and residual analysis
- Prediction and evaluation on test data with error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)
- Conclusion with insights on feature importance and interpretation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or above).

Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Linear Regression example

You can run the Linear Regression code from the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder or use the Python scripts in `src/`.

## Future Work

Plans include adding implementations for more ML algorithms like:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
- Clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.)

New algorithms will also include visualization, thorough evaluation, and practical insights.
