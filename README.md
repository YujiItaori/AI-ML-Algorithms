# AI-ML-Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various **Machine Learning algorithms** in Python. The goal is to build a comprehensive collection of ML techniques with clear, well-documented code examples and explanations to help learn and apply these algorithms effectively.

---

## Current Implementation

So far, this repository includes a detailed implementation of **Linear Regression**. The project covers:

- Loading and exploring a customer dataset
- Visualizing relationships between variables using Seaborn
- Preparing data and splitting it into training and testing sets
- Training a multivariable Linear Regression model using Scikit-Learn
- Detailed model evaluation with coefficients, R-squared score, and residual analysis
- Prediction and evaluation on test data with error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)
- Conclusion with insights on feature importance and interpretation

Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm primarily used for binary classification problems, where the output variable is categorical (such as 0/1, Yes/No). It predicts the probability that an input belongs to a particular class by using the logistic (sigmoid) function, which maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1. This model enables classification based on a threshold probability, commonly 0.5. Logistic Regression is widely used in fields like medical diagnosis, customer churn prediction, and fraud detection due to its simplicity and interpretability.

Random Forest Regression

Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. It operates by building multiple decision trees during training and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting. Random Forest can handle large datasets with higher dimensionality and is robust to noise and outliers. It is especially useful for regression tasks where relationships between variables are non-linear and complex, providing a versatile modeling approach beyond linear models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or above).

Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Linear Regression example

You can run the Linear Regression code from the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder or use the Python scripts in `src/`.

## Future Work

Plans include adding implementations for more ML algorithms like:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
- Clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.)

New algorithms will also include visualization, thorough evaluation, and practical insights.
